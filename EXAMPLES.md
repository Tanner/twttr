# Examples
By default, examples can be run with the included parser by default.

```
$ python parser.py file.twttr
```

## Hello World
Hello world can run without any modification.

```
$ python parser.py hello_world.twttr
```

## Fibonacci
For full effect, `parser.py` must be modified to run in debug mode. This is done to make it easier to view variable values.

In `main()`, change `parser.run()` to `parser.run(True)`.

From there, you can run the program as normal.

```
$ python parser.py fibonacci.twttr
```

You can view the result of the program stored in the user `sam`.

You can change the fibonacci number generated by changing the initial value of the user `tannerld`.
